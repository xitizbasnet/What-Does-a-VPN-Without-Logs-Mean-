What Does a VPN Without Logs Mean?

-----------
A no-log VPN means that the virtual private network provider does not collect, or “log,” any information transmitted through the network. They don’t save information about your personal details, where you go online, what you download, or what you search for. Therefore, your online privacy and anonymity are protected from everybody — even your VPN provider.
